                    <p class='big'>Microservice architectures are the ‘new normal’. Building small, self-contained, ready to run applications can bring great flexibility and added resilience to your code. Spring Boot’s many purpose-built features make it easy to build and run your microservices in production at scale. And don’t forget, no microservice architecture is complete without <a class='blue link-animate' th:href="@{/cloud}">Spring Cloud</a> ‒ easing administration and boosting your fault-tolerance.</p>
